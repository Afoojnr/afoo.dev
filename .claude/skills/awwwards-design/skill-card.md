## Description:

Create award-winning, memorable websites with advanced animations, creative interactions, and distinctive visual experiences for portfolios, agency showcases, product launches, and other projects where "wow factor" matters.

## Use Case:

Developers and designers use this skill to create memorable, high-craft websites with choreographed motion, distinctive typography, immersive scrolling, creative interactions, and 3D or WebGL effects when appropriate.

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Copied CDN script references can create supply-chain exposure if used directly in a production site.

Mitigation: Self-host third-party scripts or add verified Subresource Integrity before production use.

Risk: Heavy animation, smooth scrolling, and custom cursors can harm accessibility or usability when applied without fallbacks.

Mitigation: Preserve reduced-motion support, keyboard navigation, adequate contrast, and treat custom cursors as optional effects.

Risk: Rich 3D, WebGL, and scroll animation effects can degrade page performance on lower-powered devices.

Mitigation: Optimize media, lazy-load below-fold content, prefer transform-based animation, and verify animation frame rate and Core Web Vitals.
